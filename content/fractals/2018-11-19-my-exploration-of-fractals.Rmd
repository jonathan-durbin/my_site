In the fall semester of my junior year of undergrad, I worked with a friend on an independent study about agent-based modeling. I didn't have a lot of programming experience at the time, nor did I want to learn. I simply wasn't interested. We used a software called [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (good language for agent-based modeling) in our study. My friend, who had a bit more programming experience than I did, realized that this software would be good for generating the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and [Julia Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set). Below is one Julia Set he generated:

```{r julia_example, out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/fractals/images/julia_1.png")
```

<!-- ![An example julia set that was generated with NetLogo](/fractals/2018-11-19-my-exploration-of-fractals_files/julia_1.png){width=30%} ![An example julia set that was generated with NetLogo](/fractals/2018-11-19-my-exploration-of-fractals_files/julia_1.png){width=30%} -->

Naturally, I became very interested in fractals after I saw this; I copied the code he wrote and excitedly started exploring different Julia Sets even though I didn't have much experience with the code itself. I generated a few more neat looking Julia Sets, (below) but I soon became bored and forgot about the project.

```{r my_julia_example, out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(list("/fractals/images/julia_10.png", "/fractals/images/julia_2.png"))
```
