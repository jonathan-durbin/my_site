## Background

In the fall semester of my junior year of undergrad, I worked with a friend on an independent study about [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). I didn't have a lot of programming experience at the time, nor did I want to learn. I simply wasn't interested. We used a software called [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (good language for agent-based modeling) in our study. My friend, who had a bit more programming experience than I did, realized that this software would be good for generating the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and [Julia Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set). Below is one Julia Set he generated:

```{r julia_example, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/fractals/images/julia_1.png")
```

Naturally, I became very interested in fractals after I saw this; I copied the code he wrote and excitedly started exploring different Julia Sets even though I didn't have much experience with the code itself. I generated a few more neat looking Julia Sets for myself! More that I made can be found [here](https://github.com/jonathan-durbin/my_site/tree/master/content/fractals/images), I just don't have space for all of them in this article.

```{r my_julia_example}
img1 <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("images/julia_2.png")), interpolate = FALSE)
img2 <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("images/julia_3.png")), interpolate = FALSE)
img3 <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("images/julia_4.png")), interpolate = FALSE)
img4 <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("images/julia_5.png")), interpolate = FALSE)
grid.arrange(img1, img2, img3, img4, ncol = 2)
```
