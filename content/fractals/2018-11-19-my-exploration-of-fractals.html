<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the fall semester of my junior year of undergrad, I worked with a friend on an independent study about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">agent-based modeling</a>. I didn’t have a lot of programming experience at the time, nor did I want to. We used a software called <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> (good language for agent-based modeling) in our study. My friend, who had a bit more programming experience than I did, realized that this software would be good for generating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia Sets</a>. Below is one Julia Set he generated:</p>

<p>Naturally, I became very interested in fractals after I saw this; I copied the code he wrote and excitedly started exploring different Julia Sets even though I didn’t have much experience with the code itself. I generated a few more neat looking Julia Sets for myself! More that I made can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonathan-durbin/my_site/tree/master/content/fractals/images">here</a>, I just don’t have space for all of them in this article.</p>

<p>If you would like to see the files that generated these fractals, they can be found <a href="https://github.com/jonathan-durbin/my_site/tree/master/content/fractals/scripts">here</a>, but you’ll have to install NetLogo to run them.</p>

<p>I had a stronger interest in writing code upon completion of the independent study, but I had no idea where to start. Naturally, I looked to google. I searched for something like “popular programming languages” because I knew I wanted a language that is heavily documented. Eventually I settled on python as my first language. Quickly, the possibility of generating my own fractals came to mind.</p>
