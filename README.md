## Repo for Jonathan Durbin's Personal Website

I use Rstudio to write `.Rmd` files, then push them to GitHub, which are tracked by [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). Netlify uses a tool called "Hugo" to render the files in HTML format.  

The book *blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown* written by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill, was very helpful in getting this set up. The online book can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I hope to talk about various projects that I'm working on on my site. If you would like more information, feel free to submit an issue or pull request. Making your own fork of my repo to use for yourself is also encouraged!
